# Surakarta-iOS

## Preface

This is a app that implements the Surakarta Game on iOS platform. This is also an innovative project in our school. I'm going to use the neural network in this project. But I'm still reconstructing the neural network.

## Achievement

Chinese University Computer Game Competition Surakarta Game Project third prize

Unfortunately, the app did not achieve good results in the Chinese University Computer Game Competition Surakarta Game Project. In the 10 games, only two games were victorious.

The search depth of the AI is only 4 to 6 layers, compared with other people's search depth of 10 or so. But considering the performance of mobile phones, there is no way to deepen the depth.

Maybe the app's most proud of me is the animation. I use the Bezier Curves to construct the chessboard and use CAKeyframeAnimation to animate. Everyone who played with me said that my app interface was good. : )
